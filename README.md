# Novozymes-Enzyme-Stability-Prediction

nzymes are proteins that act as catalysts in the chemical reactions of living organisms. The goal of this competition is to predict the thermal stability of enzyme variants. The experimentally measured thermal stability data includes natural sequences, as well as engineered sequences with single or multiple mutations upon the natural sequences.
